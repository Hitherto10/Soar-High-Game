# Soar-High-Game

For my project I have chosen the name of my game to be “Soar High”.  Soar High is based on the iconic arcade style game “Flappy Bird”. The game is based underwater. The player controls a fish that has to move through the gaps in various obstacles that are in the form of vertical corals, one top coral and a bottom coral which move from right to left. The controls of the game are pretty straightforward, the user taps the game screen to begin, when the game has begun a form of gravity is put into play so the fish starts to sink. The user then needs to continuously tap the screen to keep the fish from sinking to the bottom and at the same time to pass through the obstacles strewn across its path.
